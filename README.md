# Basic-Calculator-Program

## Purpose
This is a basic Python program that functions as a calculator. It prompts the user to input two numbers and a mathematical operation (+, -, *, /), performs the calculation, and displays the result. The program includes error handling for invalid operations and division by zero, making it robust for simple arithmetic tasks.

It was created as a beginner-friendly project to demonstrate Python concepts like:
- User input/output
- Conditional statements (`if-elif-else`)
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Error handling

## How to Run
Follow these steps to run the calculator program on your computer:

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python is installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or verify your version by running:
  ```bash
  python --version

 ### Installation

 Clone the repository using Git:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git

### Running the Program
1. Run the program using Python:
python calculator.py (or python3 calculator.py if python doesnâ€™t work.)

2. Follow the prompts:
Enter the first number (e.g., 5 or 3.14).

Enter the second number (e.g., 2 or 0.5).

Enter an operation (+, -, *, /).

3. View the result:
The program will display the calculation (e.g., 5.0 + 3.0 = 8.0).

If you enter an invalid operation or attempt to divide by zero, an error message will appear.

#### EXAMPLE USAGE:

Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 4
Enter an operation (+, -, *, /): *
10.0 * 4.0 = 40.0

Enter the first number: 8
Enter the second number: 0
Enter an operation (+, -, *, /): /
Error: Division by zero is not allowed.


### Notes
The program accepts both whole numbers and decimals (e.g., 3 or 2.5).

It only supports four operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

If you enter a non-numeric value (e.g., "abc"), the program will crash. Future improvements could add input validation.
